                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Can money grow in a tree? The simple answer to this question is a big <strong>NO</strong>. But let's see how we grow the tree. We plant a seed in the soil. We watch the weather and accordingly take care of the young plant. On a hot day, we water the plant a little more, in cold days we water the plant little less, on a rainy day we didn't need to water the plant at all. Once seed gets grown into a strong adult tree then it gives us much more seed then what we have planted. In other words, if we use the seed in the right way, we can get many more seeds in return.

                <p>
                    Coming back to our main question "Can Money grow in a tree?". Now the answer to this question <strong>'Might be'</strong>. Of course, we cannot plant our money in the soil. So, where can we plant our money and grow its tree and get more money? The answer to this question is simple we can plant our money in Saving Accounts, Fixed Deposits(FD), Recurring Deposits(RD), Demat Account(Stock Market), etc. Now you start getting idea for what this blog is about. Yes, this blog is about investing.

                    Why I'm writting this blog?

                <p>
                    <em>"The first step is always the hardest"</em>. As a beginner, we face many difficulties and many questions that are so basic for the person who has already in the investing world that they did not even consider to talk about. When I started reading about investing there were many terms (example: inflation CAGR, index) that I don't know but in the books, they are used repeatedly. Similarly, there were many questions that got triggered very often while learning about investing (example: "does 8% -16% return is satisfactory?", "how the return on return means in compound interest makes it so powerful?", "Why should I choose those investment options that have less rate of return when we can choose options with a high rate of returns?", etc). So I decided to write a blog that can help a person to make his first step (hardest step) in the world of investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this blog, I have introduced investing and also solved questions that we faced as a beginner. This blog is also written in very easy language. At the end of this blog, you will get comfortable with some of the commonly used terms in the investment world.

                <h2>Brief introduction of investment</h2>
                <p>
                    In simple words, Investment is a technique of making money through money. Like in the process of planting the tree we give away our one seed today to get more seeds in return in future. Similarly in the process of investing, we give away our some amount of money today to get more money in the future.

                <h2>Does investment is a good option?</h2>
                <p>
                    "Does investment is a good option?". A simple answer to this question is YES. Instead, I will say investment is not an option, investment is must. Let me tell you why. If you don't invest your money in the correct way, then the purchasing power of your money will be eaten up by Inflation. The inflation rate in India was 5.5% as of May 2019. Now, what inflation rate of 5.5% really mean? It means the average cost of all the goods and services in the country will be increased by 5.5%. In other words, goods you can purchase today with  &#8377;100  after 1 year you will have to pay 105.5 for the same goods. Assuming if inflation remain same, then goods you can purchase today with  &#8377;100 after 10 years the same things will cost &#8377;145.47( i.e  45.47% extra). To keep your money purchasing power intact from inflation, investment is a must.

                <h2>Where should I invest my money?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several options for investing our money like Fixed Deposits(FD), Stock Market, Bonds, Gold, etc. To answer the question "where should I invest my money?", I should first ask myself "Why I am investing my money?". Either I am investing my money to keep it's purchasing power intact from inflation or I am investing to become rich. Because what return I will get in the future directly depends on where I have invested my money today.

                    So, from the data shown in the above table, it is clear that If I want to invest to keep the purchasing power of my money intact from inflation then Fixed Deposit is a good option, but if I want to invest to become rich then Sensex(Stock Market) is a good option and if I want to invest to get something in between then gold is a good option.

                <h2>Why should I invest in a fixed deposit for less return?</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>"Why should I aim to beat inflation and invest in Fixed Deposits to get an 8.33% return when I can aim to become rich and invest in Sensex and expect to receive 16.75% return?"</em>. To answer this question, we must first understand the risk-return relationship. Generally, High return investment also carries high risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To understand the risk-return relationship better look at the example. Suppose, I have invested my &#8377;100 in Fixed Deposit for 1 year at the rate of 8.33% return then my bank guarantees me to repay &#8377;108.33 in next year regardless of any of the circumstances of next year. Since I have guaranteed to get my money back with returns hence Fixed Deposit is less risky. Now, Suppose if I have Purchased one equity share of company â€˜X' form stock market for &#8377;100 and next year company 'X' became double in size then next year I will also receive double of my invested amount, in other words, I will receive &#8377;200 in next year. But if company 'X' does not do well and become half in size, then I will only receive half of my invested amount, in other words, I will only get &#8377;50 in next year. Since the return of equity share is not predictable hence they are risky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get the high return in the stock market either person must have great knowledge to analyze the company before investing in it or a person can invest in an index(s) like sensex and nifty-50 as they are less risky.

                <h2>"8%-16% return is not less"?</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>"8%-16% return is not less?".</em> The answer to this question is a BIG NO. 8% return is not less and 16% return is a very good return. Let me tell you why. To understand why 16% is the good return we must understand "The great power of Compound interest".
                </p>
                <h3>The great power of Compound interest</h3>
                <p>
                    Compound interest has great power because it also gives return on our return. What does return on return really mean? Suppose we invested &#8377;100 at the rate of 10% return per year, after one year we will have &#8377;100(invested amount) + &#8377;10(return on invested amount) = &#8377;110(total), after 2 years we will have  &#8377;100(Invested amount) + &#8377;10(Return on invested amount) + &#8377;10(return of last year)  +  &#8377;1(<strong>Return on the return</strong> of last year)  =  &#8377;121 So, on the second year we got one Rupee extra from our return of return, This is the great power of Compound Interest.

                <h2>Revisiting the whole process of investing</h2>
                <p>
                    We invest our some amount of money in things like Fixed deposits, gold, equity shares, these things in which we invest money and expect some return in future are known as assets. After investing our money in assets we wait for our investment to grow in value. When they get matured, then they give back out invested amount and returns.

                <h2>Can money grow in a tree??</h2>
                <p>
                    When we want to grow tree then plant out seed into the soil, But investment, we plant our money in many different places like banks, stock market, commodity market, PPF(Public Provident Fund) account, etc. When we plant the seed then we get a small tree, similarly in investment when we plant money then we get a small asset. After planting we wait for our tree to mature so it can return us more seeds. Similarly, in the investment, we wait for our asset to mature so it can return us more money. When we get our seeds or money in return, that is the time when all the patience pays off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming back to our original question <em>"Money can grow in the tree?"</em>. Now, according to me, the answer to this question is <strong>YES</strong>, money can grow in the tree but metaphorically.
